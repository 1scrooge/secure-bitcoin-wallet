# secure-bitcoin-wallet
Secure Bitcoin Wallet is a Dockernized version of Electrum Bitcoin Client with a Web frontend to run on IBM LinuxONE. The Electrum Bitcoin Client, a modified version of Electrum, runs as a JSON RPC server to maintain a bitcoin wallet by interacting with the bitcoin network. It can encrypt/decrypt a wallet file using an EP11 crypto server (zHSM) to protect the encryption key. The Electrum frontend, a modified version of Electrum for Laravel 5.4+, runs as a Web frontend to interact with bitcoin users via a Web browser. It runs on Laravel, an emerging application framework written in PHP taking advatnage of NodeJS for client-side rendering. These two components are dockernized to run in a Docker container on x86 or in an isolated container on a LinuexONE Secure Service Container (SSC).
